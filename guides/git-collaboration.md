# Practise collaboration

- Create Repo on GitHub (tick the Add a Readme box)
- Add your new best bud as a collaborator
- They need to accept the invitation before you carry on!
- Both clone the repo on your computer `git clone thelinktoyourrepo`

**CHECKPOINT**

- One person checkout a branch `git checkout -b thenameofbranch` (-b makes a new branch, checkout puts you ON that branch)
- That person makes a few changes to the files (whatever you want to do)
- They then ACP (add, commit & push). BUT make sure you push to the branch you're on `git push origin thenameofbranch`
- Go to GitHub
- Click the button that has appeared at the top of your repo
- Create the pull request
- Either person can now merge the pull request
- Both people now run `git checkout main` and `git pull` to make sure they have the most up to date version.
- Go back to the **CHECKPOINT** and begin again, but its the other persons turn now
