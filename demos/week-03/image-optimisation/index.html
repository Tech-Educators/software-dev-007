    <p>
      Open the Network Tab in dev tools and see which images load as you load
      the page at different screensizes.

    <p>
      Compare the metric witha single large image, and many smaller images using
      srcset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that sometimes metrics can vary, and can be affected by network
      speed.
