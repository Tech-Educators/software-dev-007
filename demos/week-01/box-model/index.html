    <div class="box">Hi, I'm a 152x152 box.</div>

    <p>
      Despite width and height settings being 140px each, the total of the box
      is 152px
    </p>
    <p>
      This is because the 3px of border and 3px of padding have increased the
      size
    </p>

    <div class="box box-sized">I am aCTuaLlY 140x140</div>

    <p>This box has <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code></p>
    <p>
      This means that the size we give the box will also include the padding and
      border.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both cases, margin just moves the boxes around and has NO impact on the
      size.
